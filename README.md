# Customer Churn for gas and electricity utility

        Customer churn, also called customer attrition, is the number of paying customers who fail to become repeat customers.
        In this context, churn is a quantifiable rate of change that occurs over a specified amount of time.üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

 # **Problem description:**
        Powerco is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium enterprises), and residential customers.
        The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment.
        They need help to diagnose the source of churning SME customers. A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn.
        Therefore, it is helpful to know which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current price,
        for which an excellent predictive model could be useful.
